# an-easy-suite
Automated update/zip packaging scripts for a server. Turns hours of packaging, uploading, and managing files into a '1-click' solution.
- Problem: Client needs their users to always use the most up to date files. The client automatically updates the user files on their personal Google Drive.
- Solution: Build an updater to pull the files from Google Drive, extract, and implement them to the users device.

## What I Learned

This project was an opportunity to improve my skills in automation, scripting, and cloud storage management. Through creating this script, I learned:
- **PowerShell Automation**: Writing and debugging scripts that automate repetitive tasks, making life easier for users.
- **Batch Scripting**: Using batch files to handle tasks like downloading files, running scripts, and managing admin privileges.
- **Cloud Integration**: Using Rclone to upload files to Google Drive, allowing for easy cloud storage and sharing.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Creating a simple menu system that guides users through updating their Minecraft setup, even if they aren't tech-savvy.

## Tools Used

- **Windows Batch Scripting**: Used to automate tasks in a Windows environment.
- **PowerShell**: Utilized for more advanced scripting and system management.
- **7-Zip**: Employed for compressing and decompressing files.
- **Rclone**: Used for managing files on cloud storage (Google Drive) from the command line.
- **cURL**: For downloading scripts and files from the web.


## Project Overview

This project involves three main scripts that work together to keep the client's Minecraft installation up-to-date with the latest mods and settings.

1. **`an-easy-update.bat`**: This script:
   - Runs with administrator privileges.
   - Downloads the latest `zz-an-easy-update.ps1` script from GitHub.
   - Runs the PowerShell script to update the Minecraft installation.

2. **`zz-an-easy-update.ps1`**: This PowerShell script:
   - Deletes outdated Minecraft folders and files.
   - Downloads the latest `.minecraft.zip` file from Google Drive.
   - Extracts and replaces the necessary folders and files.
   - Offers users a choice between a full update or just updating the `mods` folder.

3. **`an-easy-zipper.bat`**: This script:
   - Compresses key Minecraft folders into a `.zip` file.
   - Uploads the `.zip` file to Google Drive using Rclone.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these installed:
- **Python**: Needed for the `gdown` module to download files.
- **PIP**: To install Python packages.
- **7-Zip**: For extracting `.zip` files.
- **Rclone**: For uploading files to Google Drive.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Initial Batch File**:
   - Double-click `an-easy-update.bat` to start the process.
   - The script will request admin privileges and download the latest PowerShell script from GitHub.
   - It then runs the PowerShell script to update your Minecraft setup.

2. **Choose Your Update Option**:
   - The PowerShell script will give you two options:
     - **Full Update**: Deletes and replaces all key folders and files.
     - **Mods Only**: Just updates the `mods` folder.

3. **Upload New Files**:
   - After making changes, run `an-easy-zipper.bat` to automatically compress all updated folders and upload them to Google Drive.

### Example

Run the update script
```shell
an-easy-update.bat
```
Zip and upload the latest files
```shell
an-easy-zipper.bat
```
## Project Challenges and Solutions
1. Challenge: Handling admin privileges and secure downloads.
- Solution: I used batch scripting to ensure the script runs with admin rights and downloads the latest files securely.
2. Challenge: Making the script simple for non-tech users.
- Solution: I created a basic menu system and clear prompts to guide users through the update process.
## Conclusion
This project showcases my ability to automate processes, manage cloud storage, and create user-friendly scripts. Itâ€™s a practical example of how I can take a repetitive task and streamline it into an easy-to-use solution.

## Next Steps
I'm eager to continue improving my automation skills and exploring more advanced scripting techniques. This project has fueled my passion for making technology accessible and efficient, and I look forward to applying these skills in future challenges.
