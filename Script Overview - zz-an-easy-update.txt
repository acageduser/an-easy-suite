Script Overview (zz-an-easy-update.ps1)

This script performs updates for a Minecraft installation, offering two modes: "Full Update" and "Mods Only." 
It automates the process of downloading, extracting, replacing, and cleaning up necessary files. 
The script now defaults to always replacing files without prompting the user during the extraction process.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

1. Automatic File Replacement:
   - The script is configured to always overwrite existing files during the extraction process, ensuring no prompts 
     for user confirmation when replacing files.

2. Download the Minecraft Archive:
   - Downloads a .minecraft.zip file from a Google Drive link using gdown.
   - The file is placed in the same directory where the script is executed.

3. Cleanup:
   - Removes the downloaded .minecraft.zip file and the temporary extraction folder after the update process, 
     once the user exits the script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update Options:

1. Full Update:
   - Step 1: Deletes the existing mods folder located in the same directory as the script.
   - Step 2: Extracts the downloaded .minecraft.zip file using 7-Zip. The extraction occurs in the same directory 
             where the script is run (the "extract here" option), and the extracted contents overwrite any existing files.
   - Step 3: All files and folders inside .minecraft.zip replace their old counterparts.
   - Step 4: Cleanup happens after the user exits the script (deletes the downloaded .minecraft.zip file).

2. Mods Only:
   - Step 1: Deletes the existing mods folder located in the same directory as the script.
   - Step 2: Creates a temporary folder called minecraft_temp_extract.
   - Step 3: Extracts the contents of the .minecraft.zip archive into the minecraft_temp_extract folder using 7-Zip.
   - Step 4: Copies only the contents of the mods folder from minecraft_temp_extract back to the main directory 
             (one level above where the script is run).
   - Step 5: Cleanup happens after the user exits the script (deletes the minecraft_temp_extract folder and 
             the downloaded .minecraft.zip file).
