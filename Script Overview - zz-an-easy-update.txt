Script Overview (zz-an-easy-update.ps1)

This script performs updates for a Minecraft installation with a single "Full Update" option. 
It automates the process of downloading, extracting, replacing, and cleaning up necessary files. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

1. Full Update Mode:
   - Automatically deletes the existing mods folder and replaces it with the contents from the latest .minecraft.zip file.
   - Overwrites existing files without prompting the user for confirmation.

2. Download the Minecraft Archive:
   - Downloads a .minecraft.zip file from a Google Drive link using gdown.
   - The file is placed in the same directory where the script is executed.

3. Cleanup:
   - Removes the downloaded .minecraft.zip file after the update process, only when the user exits the script by pressing Enter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update Process:

1. Full Update:
   - Step 1: Deletes the existing mods folder located in the same directory as the script.
   - Step 2: Extracts the downloaded .minecraft.zip file using 7-Zip. The extraction occurs in the same directory where 
             the script is run (the "extract here" option), and the extracted contents overwrite any existing files.
   - Step 3: Cleans up by deleting the .minecraft.zip file after the user exits the script.
